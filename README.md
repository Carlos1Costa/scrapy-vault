Crawler to browse through The Vault
https://vimm.net/vault

**Please dont use it!!**

I started this project because it seemed possible to check all files with MD5 within the zip file itself. But after I started, I realized that not all files contain the txt with the MD5. Well, if I were to start again, I would make the crawler to download directly from [No-Intro](https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/), it would have been much faster. Eventually I will do that.

If you decide to use this crawler, please keep the throtle I setup, don't overload the guys' server. Be respectful!
